# Custom scripts
A few custom scripts for small quality of life improvements
## Second monitor only
Turns off the inbuilt laptop display and uses only the external display which is how I work most of the time. A small bash script using _xrandr_ that can be run at autostart. 

- [ ] May be make a panel applet to make switching easier
