# Custom scripts
A few custom scripts for small quality of life improvements
## Second monitor only
Turns off the inbuilt laptop display and uses only the external display which is how I work most of the time. A small bash script using _xrandr_ that can be run at autostart. 

- [ ] May be make a panel applet to make switching easier

## Open or get focus
If the program passed as argument already has an open window, makes that the active window and raises it up. Otherwise opens a new instance and raises that up. Not a foolproof 
script but works pretty well for my case.
